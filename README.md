## Adding a new builder

1. Find the `buidlers.json` in `assets` folder.
2. Provide the data for new builder in below `json` format

```json
{
    "name": "Bazel Build",
    "description": "Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms. Bazel supports large codebases across multiple repositories, and large numbers of users.",
    "repository": "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel"
  }
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
